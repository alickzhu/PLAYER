your story
Your surname is "Sun" and your nickname is "Tian'er". You were born in the twelfth year of Guangxu's reign in the Qing Dynasty (1886). You are a native of Chaohu. You live in the north of "Barren Mountain". Your parents died early. Your elder brother [Sun Xian'en] is older than you. 10 years older, I go to work as a waterman on a boat in the lake to earn money to support you. Sometimes I put the delicious food on the boat in a food box and bring it home to you.
When you were 8 years old (1893), your brother went to "Cuizhuang" to borrow money and owed a debt in order to marry a wife...Shortly after your brother got married, the nursing home of "Cui Zhuang" [Zhou Mengdang] arrived. Your family asked for interest, but when your brother refused to pay, they found a "Zhang Pozai", took you away, and sent you to the creditor's house to work in order to pay off the interest.
"Zhang Pozai" said that your family can't repay the money at all, so why not take the painting you sold and exchange it for a few taels of silver... Thanks to Taitai (Wang Shi)'s maid [Bao Liu] for speaking for you, That's why I kept you here - Taitai changed your name to [Bao Gan] based on your nickname and made you a maid - you were taken care of by "Sister Bao Liu" at that time. She taught you how to do things carefully and comforted you by saying, "Wait a minute." If your brother collects the money, he can come and pick you up...
The following year (1894), Taitai's sister [Xi Yan] was brought to live in "Cui Zhuang". Master [Cui Shouheng] asked you to serve [Xi Yan] personally and live with her in "Beiyuan" (Xi Yan Fang). 
Another year passed (1895), you saw that the Mid-Autumn Festival had passed, the cool breeze was starting to rise, and you still didn't see your brother coming to redeem you, you became more and more homesick, and served [Xi Yan] absent-mindedly, bringing her the face wash. There was only hot water in the room, so you scalded her and she yelled - you felt aggrieved and started to cry.
[Xi Yan] raised his hand to hit you, and you ran out immediately - [Xi Yan] chased him into the yard, met "Sister Bao Liu", and was stopped by her, so he didn't succeed and still refused to give up. You said I would beat you to death when you came back! You are scared, hiding behind "Sister Bao Liu", crying and begging her to help you - you want to go home!
"Sister Bao Liu" advised you to give up this idea, but you didn't listen to her this time. You secretly escaped from "Cuizhuang" and ran to the "Big Pier". You waited until the boat docked and saw your brother coming down from it. Then he ran over and said he wanted to go home with him... When my brother saw you, he was overjoyed at first, and then frowned. He was worried that after you ran away, the creditor would not give up and go to your house to arrest people, so he shook his head and said Can't take you home.
In order to prevent you from being caught, your brother took you to hide at the foot of the "Barren Mountain" and asked you to hide in a cave behind a pavilion. When he returned home, he packed a few buns for you in a food box and brought you a thick coat. After that, I’ll give you food every two days... You thought it would be fine after a while, but you didn’t expect [Zhou Mengdang] to follow your brother and find the entrance of the cave - your brother wanted to stop [Zhou Mengdang] from entering the cave. , was kicked down by him.
My brother wanted to protect you, so he picked up a stone on the ground to hit [Zhou Mengdang]. Unexpectedly, [Zhou Mengdang] had quick eyesight and quick hands. He raised the crossbow he carried with him and shot his brother's leg with an arrow. He fell to the ground and screamed in pain!
You ran to your brother, hugged him, and saw the blood flowing from his leg dyeing your clothes red - [Zhou Mengdang] strode over, you wanted to hit him, but he grabbed him like a chicken. , brought you back to "Cuizhuang", and before handing you over to [Xi Yan], I will lock you in the "South Courtyard" until you are too hungry and have no strength and promise not to escape, then I will send you to the "North Courtyard", continue Serve【Xi Yan】.
[Cui Shouheng] then made the decision to marry "Sister Bao Liu" to [Zhou Mengdang] - after you heard about it, you ran to "Sister Bao Liu" and wanted to tell her that [Zhou Mengdang] was not a good person! "Sister Bao Liu" hugged you without waiting for you to speak, and told you a piece of bad news - it turned out that after your brother's leg was injured by [Zhou Mengdang] with a crossbow arrow, he did not seek medical treatment in time, which caused the wound to worsen and he had a high fever for several days. No retreat... passed away last night!
A few days later, [Zhou Mengdang] married "Sister Bao Liu" in "Cuizhuang". You kept your brother's hatred in mind and watched "Sister Bao Liu" marrying your enemy. Then you got angry with her and stopped looking for her. You only heard that she had brought her younger brother to "Cuizhuang". In addition, there was [Zhou Mengdang] His younger brother [Zhou Chitong] lived with them - when you were imprisoned in the "South Courtyard", [Zhou Chitong] once brought you water - the well in the "South Courtyard" was already a dry well at that time. [Zhou Mengdang] used an iron chain to lock a wooden board on top and seal the well mouth.
The next year (1896), "Sister Bao Liu" gave birth to a boy. Because he was illiterate, he asked Taitai to name his son [Lianyi] (Zhou Lianyi) - Taitai was also pregnant at that time, "Sister Bao Liu" "After confinement, I moved back to the "North Courtyard" with [Lianyi] in my arms, and lived in the "West House", taking care of the children and taking care of Taitai at the same time.
[Xi Yan] I took you to the "Master's Room" to see Taitai every day, so you met "Sister Bao Liu". Seeing her raising children for the enemy, you became even more angry and deliberately avoided her - during that time of yours I didn’t see [Zhou Mengdang], and I was eager to know the whereabouts of my enemy, but I didn’t want to ask “Sister Bao Liu”. In the end, I could only pretend to go to [Zhou Chitong] to thank him (for bringing him water at that time), and learned from his mouth I know that [Zhou Mengdang] went out to join the army when "Sister Bao Liu" was pregnant... You often went to chat with [Zhou Chitong] and took the opportunity to inquire about his brother's situation, and gradually became familiar with him - in [Zhou Chitong] In front of me, you still call [Bao Liu] "Sister Bao Liu".
In early winter, Taitai gave birth to a daughter, named [Yannan] (Cui Yannan).
In the following years, [Zhou Mengdang] returned to "Cuizhuang" to visit relatives every year, but you couldn't find a chance to take revenge.
When you were 14 years old (1899), you heard that Taitai wanted to find an in-law for [Xi Yan], but had not decided yet.
A year later (1900), when you went to find [Zhou Chitong] at his residence, you saw that there was no one in the house, and there was a "big key" hanging on the wall. Judging from the size, it was the wooden plank used to lock the dry well. ······You took off the key, went to the "South Courtyard" to open the wooden board on the dry well, and put the key back without being noticed by anyone - you could never forget your brother's revenge, and finally figured out something you should have understood a long time ago. The truth - before you ran away, you only told "Sister Bao Liu" that you wanted to go home. She must have been the tip-off. She married an enemy. Damn it!
The next night, when you were chatting with [Zhou Chitong], you saw "Sister Bao Liu" carrying [Lianyi] to the house where [Zhou Chitong] lived, and you decided to take action! You return to the "North Courtyard" and wait for "Sister Bao Liu" to return to the "West Room" with the child in her arms, then call her out of the room in the yard - you deliberately did not call her "Sister Bao Liu", just "Bao" Liu], wait for her to come out of the house, trick her into following you to the "South Courtyard", hit her on the back of the head with a stone from behind, then push the body down the dry well and lock the board..."Sister Bao Liu "After she disappeared, Taitai asked [Zhou Chitong] to take [Lianyi] out of the "North Courtyard" where the female relatives lived, and live with him and "Sister Bao Liu's" brother.
You later heard [Zhou Chitong] say that his brother came back to visit relatives and did not see his wife. He went to the river outside the village to drink. After he got drunk, he came back and said that when he became a general, he would pick up his relatives and leave "Cuizhuang"... ·
After the Mid-Autumn Festival, Taitai felt unwell, so she lent you to the "main house" to help her take care of [Yannan] - Taitai never beat or scolded you, and even taught you how to read, so you took good care of [Yannan] with your heart, and soon I heard that [Xi Yan] 】 Living or dying in her room... At the end of autumn, as soon as Taitai recovered from her illness, she went to live with Xi Yan.
After winter, [Xi Yan] married [Cui Shouheng] as a concubine and worked with her sister... [Cui Shouheng] doted on [Xi Yan] very much. When she saw her quarreling with Taitai, she said she didn't want to be with her sister. After living together, he agreed that she should stay in the original house. He went to spend the night with her - the "Master's Room" and "Xi Yan's Room" were door-to-door. At night, the young [Yannan] disappeared and [Cui Shouheng] returned " "Master's Room", clamoring to go to my aunt to call daddy back - Taitai could only sigh, and deliberately avoid it, let you hold [Yannan], and go to the "South Courtyard" with her to spend the night... Yannan] is still crying for daddy. You are afraid that she will get close to the dry well, so you hug her tightly.
When you were 16 years old (1901), you were left by Taitai. [Cui Shouheng] planned to buy [Xi Yan] a new maid. When you went to the "main house" to get money, you discovered that there was money missing from the locked box under the bed. I couldn't help but Furious.
[Cui Shouheng] First of all, he thought it was a house thief, so he went to the "front yard" and searched everyone's residence. He didn't find the money, so he suspected that Taitai had stolen it... Taitai was so angry that he fell ill that night. , the doctor diagnosed that he had caught a cold - [Cui Shouheng] heard Taitai coughing and was worried about the infection, so he asked Taitai to move to the "West House" - you know [Cui Shouheng] was afraid of getting cold and sick, so every year after the Mid-Autumn Festival, he would stay in the house He puts an iron charcoal basin in the room and puts in burning charcoal for heating at night. In order to avoid getting "charcoal poison", he will open the small window in the room for ventilation when burning charcoal.
【Yannan】Don't want to leave your mother, so you take her to live in the "West House", take care of Taitai at the same time, boil medicine every day... Even so, Taitai didn't make it through the winter.
On the day Taitai passed away, you heard that [Xi Yan] asked the "kitchen" to make "red bean wine", so you talked to Taitai about it, and Taitai said she wanted to drink it too... You go to the "kitchen" When I brought it to Taitai, I heard that the master had taken away all the prepared "red bean wine rice", so I went to the "Xi Yan Room" to ask for it. [Cui Shouheng] gave you a bowl and asked you to add some rock sugar and boil it... You went to the "kitchen", added rock sugar and boiled it, and brought it back to Taitai.
Not long after Taitai finished drinking, her condition suddenly worsened and she began to cough up blood. She said that if she died, she would leave all the jewelry to [Xi Yan]... After that, before the doctor could come, Taitai died, and her body His face was black and blue.
After Taitai passed away, [Yannan] cried very sadly, and you stayed with her... Later, when you chatted with [Zhou Chitong], you talked about Taitai, and heard him say that his brother had not been with him this year. Return to "Cuizhuang".
After the New Year (1902), [Xi Yan] was straightened up and became the new Taitai. With [Cui Shouheng] bought her new maid (Bao Gui), she still stayed in the original residence (Xi Yan Fang) .
At the end of summer, [Zhou Mengdang] returned to "Cuizhuang" to pick up his younger brother and son, as well as the younger brother of "Sister Bao Liu" - you didn't know that the enemy would not come back until [Zhou Chitong] came to you to say goodbye. When he returned to "Cui Village", he could only pretend to be reluctant to leave [Zhou Chitong] and ask him to promise to keep in touch, so as not to lose traces of his enemy from now on.
Three years later (1904), you were adopted as an aunt by [Cui Shouheng] and asked to move from the "West House" to the "Housekeeper's House", saying that they would change your name to something less like a maid. You remembered your nickname and your brother's name, and changed your name to [Tian Chou] to remember the revenge of his murder... [Yannan] couldn't bear to leave you, so she ran to her father to make a fuss. [Cui Shouheng] was very angry. He not only scolded [Yannan] for losing her mother, but also asked her to move out of the "North Courtyard" and live in the "South Courtyard", where she would be taken care of by a maid (Bao Yang).
Although you are afraid of going to the "South Courtyard", you still go there to visit [Yannan] from time to time, and sometimes see [Xi Yan] there - you don't dare to stay in the "South Courtyard" overnight, but fortunately you are your aunt, so at night I have to go back to the "Master's Room" to accompany the master... Ever since he lost his money, my father has been extra careful. Not only does he carry the key to the lock box with him, but he will also lock the door from the "Master's Room" before going to bed. You won't be able to get in if you come back late.
In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), men cut off their braids and men and women were no longer strictly prohibited from meeting each other.
Last year (1913), you heard [Yannan] say that she wanted to go to school, so you went to [Cui Shouheng] to plead for her to go to a new-style school in Hefei City to live and study. From then on, [Yannan] only went to school during festivals or holidays. After returning, the maid who originally took care of her moved to the "West House" in the "North Courtyard" and continued to serve the female family members.
This year (1914), in September, [Yannan] stayed in "Cuizhuang" after returning from school, and the whole family spent the Mid-Autumn Festival (October 4) together.
On October 12th, you heard that [Zhou Chitong] came to "Cui Zhuang" to visit. Because the house he lived in before had been used as a "utility room", [Cui Shouheng] left [Zhou Chitong] to live in the "front yard" "guest room".
If you want to inquire about the enemy's movements, secretly go to the "guest room" to meet [Zhou Chitong], chat about the past, and say that you had no choice but to become a concubine, change your name, etc... [Zhou Chitong] suddenly became excited, He said that he has not forgotten you all these years, and then said that he would ask [Cui Shouheng] to invest in building a factory for him. In a few days, the elder brother will come to interview [Cui Shouheng]... After everything is done, he will be the factory long!
You heard that [Zhou Mengdang] was going to meet [Cui Shouheng], and you couldn't help laughing when you thought that you finally had a chance to take revenge. Afraid of exposing your flaws, you quickly looked out the window and stood up, saying that you wanted to go back to the "main room" to serve. Master - when you left, I felt that [Zhou Chitong] was reluctant to leave you.
In the next two days, you went to the "guest room" to spend some time with [Zhou Chitong] every day. Seeing that he looked anxious and eager to spend the night with you, you knew you could use him in the future.
On the afternoon of October 15th, [Cui Shouheng] said that he wanted to go to the pier for an appointment with an old friend, and then went to the "guest room" to find [Zhou Chitong] and took a car together - you guessed that the old friend was [Zhou Mengdang].
【Yannan】come to the "Housekeeper's Room" and take you with her to chat with 【Xi Yan】. During this period, you heard the maid say that a big boat came from the pier and saw the master going up there... You thought about [Cui Shouheng] going to meet [Zhou Mengdang] again, so you said you wanted to watch the fun, and [Yannan] begged [Xi Yan] who was Taitai to take you out.
[Xi Yan] nodded in agreement. After dressing up, the three of you went out together. You walked around "Cui Village" along the road and walked towards the lake. You saw a three-story boat parked next to the big pier. Two people pulled out from the first deck. A long wire was connected to the trees on the west side of the big pier, and was connected to several glass products.
[Zhou Chitong] in a suit and two young men were standing under the tree. When they saw you, they came over.


Act 2:
The story after the pleasantries
You and [Yannan] both accepted [Zhou Chitong]’s invitation, and [Xi Yan] also nodded in agreement, followed [Zhou Chitong] and the others onto the painting boat, carefully bypassing the generators, wires and tools installed in front of the painting boat, and walked Enter the "Banquet Hall" and meet [Cui Shouheng] and [Zhou Mengdang] who are having a drink inside - [Zhou Mengdang] is wearing casual clothes and stands up to welcome him. [Zhou Chitong] says to watch "Incandescent Light" together after dark, and then Talking about the past in "Cuizhuang"... You can't help but feel nervous when facing your enemy, and you deliberately lower your head and don't look at him.
After all, men and women are different, [Xi Yan] then took you and [Yannan] to the "small banquet hall" on the second floor for a drink, while the men stayed in the "banquet hall" - you kept telling yourself that you couldn't miss this opportunity because you were so excited , couldn't help but drink a few more glasses of old wine.
When it got dark, everyone walked out of the cabin and stood on the south deck of the first floor of the boat. They were blown by the cool breeze and sobered up a little - [Su Nian] went to turn the hand-cranked "generator" and the current was quickly connected to the small electric light. On the sky, they emit a fleeting light - they are not dazzling, just like the rotten grass is a firefly, and it is difficult to compete with the bright moon...
You had just had a few too many drinks, and when you were shaken by the light, your steps were unsteady, and [Yannan] helped you in time. You said you felt uncomfortable due to the wind, so [Yannan] offered to accompany you upstairs to rest for a while, and then helped you into the cabin.
At this time [Su Nian] stopped the joystick, [Xi Yan] [Zhou Chitong] followed [Yannan] and you went upstairs... [Yannan] helped you walk into the "small banquet hall" and sit down, you I was lying on the table while drunk, and then I heard a drunken man's voice shouting [Yannan] from below, which sounded like [Cui Shouheng].
[Xi Yan] pulled [Yannan] outside the "small banquet hall". At this time, only you and [Zhou Chitong] were inside - you lowered your voice and said to [Zhou Chitong] in a drunken manner: "I drank too much. , I'm afraid I can't leave now... Come and see me off later..." [Zhou Chitong] seemed to understand something, almost laughed out loud, then nodded repeatedly and walked out of the "small banquet hall" ".
[Xi Yan] came over and shook you awake on the table, asking you are you feeling better now?
After you said a few drunken words to [Xi Yan], you lay down on the table again and closed your eyes - [Xi Yan] saw you answering randomly and knew that you couldn't wake up for a while, so he had no choice but to walk out.
You lie down for a while, feeling that the alcohol has subsided. Seeing that [Xi Yan] has not come back, you walk out of the "small banquet hall" and go downstairs to the door of the "banquet hall". You see candlelight inside, and the door is just closed - you Through the crack in the door, I saw [Xi Yan] and [Zhou Mengdang] discussing the marriage of [Yannan] and [Lianyi] inside. I wonder if their horoscopes are suitable. They should find someone to approve them first... It seems Can't finish right away.
You have already thought of a solution from what [Cui Shouheng] called [Yannan] just now, and you deliberately asked outside the "Banquet Hall" door: "Taitai, I'm going back, will you come with me?" [Xi Yan] This is Before Shi could finish talking, he replied: "I still have something to talk about. You should go back first."
"Okay, Taitai." You agreed, turned around and left without entering the "banquet hall", and then hid in the "kitchen" next door, holding your breath and listening to the movement outside - after a while, you heard footsteps , and heard the door of the "Banquet Hall" open, and someone came out... Your heart was beating hard, and you tried to stay calm - you guessed that [Xi Yan] had gone back, and you just wanted to find something that could kill your enemy. The murder weapon.
You picked up the four kitchen knives in the "kitchen" one after another and quickly determined that it was impossible for you to kill the military attache [Zhou Mengdang] with just these kitchen utensils - you put down the kitchen knife and thought that [Zhou Mengdang] was definitely He knew how to carry crossbows and other weapons, so he walked up to the second floor and faced several rooms. He felt that [Zhou Mengdang] must live in the larger guest room, so he walked into "Room C" to look for the murder weapon.
It was as you expected - you saw the pistol and the crossbow and three arrows that [Zhou Mengdang] used to shoot his brother in the "Bing Room". You didn't know how to use a pistol, so you immediately chose the crossbow arrows - there is nothing better than this. The secondary crossbow is a better revenge weapon!
You pick up the crossbow, pull the string hard, load an arrow, go downstairs into the "banquet hall", and shoot the crossbow arrow into the heart of [Zhou Mengdang] who is sitting on the chair - [Zhou Mengdang] is unprepared , without even recognizing who you were, he was hit by an arrow, fell to the ground along with the chair, and died.
You throw the crossbow out of the window on the north side of the "Banquet Hall", then walk out of the "Banquet Hall", turn around and close the door of the "Banquet Hall", stand in the cabin corridor on the first floor, look outside through the window, and soon see someone holding a The lantern ran to the "big pier", it was [Zhou Chitong].
In your plan, you have to use [Xi Yan] and [Zhou Chitong] to prove your innocence - you have to pretend that you left the painting when [Xi Yan] and [Zhou Mengdang] were talking in the "banquet hall", Since then I have been with [Zhou Chitong].
After you wait for [Zhou Chitong] to step onto the deck, ask outside the "banquet hall": "Taitai, I'm going back, will you come with me?" Then you imitate [Xi Yan]'s voice and reply: "I still have some We have something to discuss, so go back first.”
"Okay, Taitai." You agreed outside the door of the candlelit "Banquet Hall", turned around and left without entering the "Banquet Hall" - as soon as you walked out of the cabin, you met [Zhou Chitong] head-on.
You and [Zhou Chitong] met in private. Naturally, you were afraid of being discovered by people in the cabin, so you didn't dare to say anything. You carefully walked around the pile of things installed in front of the boat and got off the boat together. At this time, you thought that you were going to meet [Zhou Chitong] together, we can’t go back to “Cui Village”, so we can only go to “that place”!
You take [Zhou Chitong] with you, and he holds the lantern, and he and you run to the foot of the "Barren Mountain" and hide in the cave behind the pavilion... [Zhou Chitong] is impatient and hugs you after putting down the lantern. .
You wanted to say something more to [Zhou Chitong], but unexpectedly you couldn't help crying... You finally avenged your brother. The feelings you had suppressed for many years were like water bursting from the dam, and you couldn't control it at all. live.
You kept crying, and [Zhou Chitong] could only keep comforting you. By the time you stopped crying, it was already October 16th... [Zhou Chitong] hugged you, and you shrank in his arms and closed your eyes. , fell asleep soon...
At dawn, you woke up in [Zhou Chitong]’s arms and heard [Zhou Chitong] say that he would take you to beg your elder brother... You didn’t understand what he meant, and you wanted to go back and see what happened after your enemy died. , followed [Zhou Chitong] back to the "Big Pier" and walked onto the boat.
You and [Zhou Chitong] walked around the pile of things installed in front of the boat and walked into the cabin on the first floor. You saw [Xi Yan] coming down from the second floor, [Yannan] coming out of the "first room", and [Lianyi] in the cabin corridor. He pulled [Su Nian] up, pointed at the "banquet hall" and shouted: "My father was killed!"

next story
At noon, you all saw the body of [Zhou Mengdang] and stayed on the boat together, keeping everything on the boat as it was. Just when you were about to discuss and come to a conclusion, "Uncle Fu", the steward of "Cuizhuang", ran into the cabin.
"Uncle Fu" was panting and said that he came to see Taitai, his aunt and the young lady... When "Uncle Fu" saw you, he first asked you to salute, and then talked about how he saw [Lianyi] at dawn. 】I came out of "North Courtyard" to say goodbye to him. I took the lantern I borrowed from him last night and hurriedly left "Cuizhuang". It seemed that I had already said hello to the master - "Uncle Fu" remembered that the master was drunk last night. I'm back, I don't dare to disturb you right away...
After daybreak, "Uncle Fu" still didn't see the master get up and come out, so he went to knock on the door outside the "main house", but no one answered.
"Uncle Fu" said that he tried to push the door open at that time and found that the door of the "main house" was bolted from the inside. Knowing that the master had the habit of locking the door before going to bed, he knocked hard several times and called to the master, "Uncle Fu" There was still no movement inside - "Uncle Fu" was now panicked. He couldn't find Taitai, his aunt and the young lady at home. He heard that they were all invited to the "Hua Fang" yesterday, and only the young lady accompanied the master back at night. But he is not in "Cuizhuang" at this time.
meaning.
"Uncle Fu" didn't dare to make his own decisions, so he could only come here and find Taitai, his aunt and the young lady to go back and take the initiative.
After [Xi Yan] listened, he took you and [Yannan] home. [Zhou Chitong] and [Su Nian] and [Lianyi] also accompanied you. They followed "Uncle Fu" back to "Cuizhuang" and walked After entering the "North Courtyard", I tried knocking on the door of the "Master's Room" several times, but there was still no response.
[Yannan] got anxious and asked "Uncle Fu" to quickly find someone to break the door open - [Zhou Chitong] and [Su Nian] and [Lianyi] didn't wait for "Uncle Fu" to call the servants, and worked together to open the door of the "house master's room". "The door burst open - as the latch was broken, the door finally opened. You walked in and saw [Cui Shouheng] lying on his side on the bed, his face remained red as if he was drunk, but he was motionless, [Zhou Chitong] stepped forward and tried it with his hands, and hurriedly told everyone that [Cui Shouheng] was dead and his body was cold...
[Yannan] burst into tears immediately. Just like when Taitai passed away, you held her in your arms again. When you looked back and saw [Xi Yan]'s beautiful face turned pale - you looked around the room with your peripheral vision and saw the small window from The room was open, the brazier was overturned against the wall, and there was an empty bowl on the table next to the bed...
